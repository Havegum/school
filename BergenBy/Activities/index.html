        <h2>Bergen Day Trips</h2>
        <p>The Bergen region has a fantastic coastline with thousands of islands. Small, picturesque villages line the fjords, and out by the ocean small fishing villages seem to cling precariously to the rocky shore. From gentle and mild to rough and wild – this is a land of contrasts. And all of it is authentic and natural, and easy to get to on a day trip from Bergen.</p>

        <h2>Guided Tours of Bergen</h2>
        <p>During the summer we recommend one of the regular guided walking tours of Bryggen. To stroll through Bryggen’s narrow alleyways and overhanging galleries is to step back into the mists of time and a bygone era. Bryggen is very much a living part of the cultural heritage that is still in active use in this historical area of the city.</p>

        <h2>Glacier tours from Bergen</h2>
        <p>Visit a glacier on a day trip from Bergen. Join a guided glacier walk, see the Norwegian Glacier Museum or enjoy the glacier from your kayak. The choice is yours! The tours to the glaciers are only available in the summer season from June - September.</p>
